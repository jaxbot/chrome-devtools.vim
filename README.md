chrome-devtools.vim
===================

New and non-working for anything useful at this time, but progressing well.

Basically, this will allow access to the Chrome Remote Debugging API from within Vim. 
I'm thinking I'll have it connect, pull down the JSON, parse it, and make a menu of tabs, then output the console messages
and such as a start point.

Most of this is technically in the code but not put together in a usable fashion yet.

Star it if you want updates on when it's ready.
